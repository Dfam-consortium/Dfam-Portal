    <p>
    The Seed Alignment Coverage and Whisker Plot shows the number of sequences
    in the seed alignment representing each position in the model and their alignment
    quality.
    </p>

    <p>
    Alignment quality is coded by colored bars. Each seed alignment is
    represented by a horizontal line, and each colored segment within the line
    indicates the alignment quality of the seed sequence to the model.

  <h3>Dfam Models</h3>
  <p>
  Models in Dfam are provided in two forms: a consensus sequence and a profile
  HMM (Hidden Markov Model). Both of these models are built from the same set
  of aligned representative sequences, termed the seed alignment. For each
  profile HMM, three thresholds are defined per associated species. The
  gathering threshold is appropriate for masking sequences that match the model
  specificity; it is is set using knowledge of the approximate copy number to
  yield high sensitivity with low false discovery rates. This threshold is used
  when defining the model's expected false discovery rate.  When annotating
  sequences that fall outside of the model's specificity, the more stringent
  trusted cutoff threshold should be used. The noise cut-off indicates the
  score of the highest scoring match that falls below the gathering threshold.
  </p>

  <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>
  This section includes some details of both the profile HMM along with the
  consensus sequence bases.
  </p>

  <h3>HMM Logo</h3>
  <p>
  A representation of the per-position residue and indel conservation of the
  profile HMM . Each position in the model is represented by a stack of
  letters, with stack height indicating the information content of the
  position. The rate and expected length of insertions after each position are
  shown in the fields below each stack. The logo can be zoomed using the '-'
  and '+' on-screen buttons to show more or less of the model as desired. It is
  also possible to center the logo by entering a column number in the field
  provided.
  </p>

  <h3>Coverage, Conservation, and Inserts</h3>
  <p>
  The Coverage, Conservation, and Inserts plot shows, for hits above a variety
  of thresholds, (1) the distribution of hits along the model, (2) the
  position-specific levels of conservation of those hits, and (3) the
  position-specific rates of insertion among those hits. For a selected
  threshold, the purple line shows, for each model position, the fraction of
  all hits that have a match to that position, considering only RPH-filtered
  hits (hits for which this model is deemed to fit the sequence better than any
  other Dfam model). Among RPH-filtered hits, the green line shows, for each
  position, the average percent identity for the position. The grey line shows
  the number of insertions among those hits. In the 'Threshold' drop-down,
  each threshold is accompanied by the number of hits meeting it, in parentheses.
  </p>

  <p>
  The figure below shows an example of the plot for the model Kanga1,
  representing the 214 RPH-filtered matches to the Human genome with
  E-value better than 1e-4. The purple line indicates that hits tend not to be
  full-length (the middle section is covered by only a few percent of hits),
  and that only about 30% of hits are aligned to the 3' end, where coverage is
  greatest. The green line shows that sequence conservation is on average
  around 70%, but with some variability. The grey lines show that inserts are
  generally rare, but at model position 1567, roughly 8 hits have
  insertions.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3>Non-Redundant Coverage</h3>
  <p>
  The Non-Redundant Coverage plot shows the distribution across the model for all
  above-threshold hits for which this model is deemed to fit the sequence better
  than any other Dfam model.
  </p>

  <p>
  The figure below shows the non-redundant coverage for the model Kanga1. This
  example plot shows a common signal for DNA transposons, with the interior
  portion of the model covered by fewer instances than the termini, since
  non-autonomous TEs can suffer various degrees of internal deletion, yet must
  retain critical terminal features. Many of the 5' terminal hits fall between
  the gathering threshold and trusted cutoff threshold,
  leading to a terminal light green bulge on the sides of the plot.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3>Redundant Coverage</h3>
  <p>
  This plot is much like the Non-Redundant Coverage plot, but instead of showing
  distribution across the model for only those matches that are best hit by this
  model, it shows the distribution for all hits to the model, even those better
  hit by some other model.
  </p>

  <p>
  The figure below shows the redundant coverage for SVA_A. SVAs carry two
  reverse-complemented Alu fragments, one from positions 60 to 315 of the SVA
  model, and another shorter fragment from position 315 to 400. The first of
  these regions hits most of the Alu instances in the human genome, leading to
  the very large spike of over 1 million above-threshold hits covering that
  region, even though there are only a few thousand SVA copies. These Alu
  instances are better hit by one of the Alu models, and thus do not show up in
  the non-redundant coverage plot or related hit counts.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3>False Coverage Plot</h3>
  <p>
  This plot shows how matches to an artificial benchmark sequence not containing
  any TE insertions are distributed across the model. This plot helps identify
  model regions that may be responsible for generating false positive hits, for
  example due to low-complexity or simple repeat characteristics.

  The figure below shows an example False Coverage Plot, for MER4-int. It shows a
  spike of 36 false hits with E-value better than 1, covering a window around
  position 800 of the model, and a small tail of false hits out to position 1100.
  Only the few hits signified by the purple part of the graph have E-value better
  than 1e-4.

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
  This table contains the is the number of matches found between the model and
  each associated genome at the gathering and trusted cut-off thresholds. Note
  that a particular subsequence matching one model may also match other
  profiles HMMs in the database, resulting in what we refer to as 'redundant
  profile hits' (RPHs). This subsequence will impact the redundant counts for
  those other entries as well. For non-redundant counts, a sequence will only
  be counted for the model deemed to be the best fit to the sequence (though a
  small number of cases, more than one model may be counted because of the
  conservative nature of the RPH filter).
  </p>

  <p>
  The number of genomic matches that are found for many TE entries means that
  it is difficult to provide all matches via a web interface or as a multiple
  sequence alignment. The karyotype ideogram shows the distribution of hits for
  the entry against a particular genome as a heat map style representation.
  Each color represents a binned ranged of counts. Each color band is
  clickable, with the hits corresponding to that location loaded below the
  karyotype ideogram. The table contains the match score, E-value, and
  positions in the respective model and sequence. The alignment between the
  model and sequence can be obtained by expanding the row using the &gt; symbol
  found at the beginning of each row. In the alignment, the model line
  represents the consensus sequence for aligned states in the model, colored
  according to the match line. The PP line represents the posterior
  probability, or degree of confidence in each aligned residue (for example,
  with '*' meaning highest confidence, and low numbers indicating low
  confidence), with corresponding grey scale coloration of the Query sequence.
  </p>

  <p>
  By default, the hits counted here are only those in which this model was
  determined to better explain the sequence than any other model. To see
  distribution of all hits to the model (including those preferred by other
  models), select "All Hits".
  </p>

  <p>
  The example below shows the non-uniform distribution of MIRs across the human
  genome. Large patches of white in the hit distribution ideogram indicate
  regions with no instances of the model; in this case these are particularly
  difficult to sequence heterochromatic regions (represented by Ns in the genome
  sequence) as can be seen by toggling karyotype bands. Below the karyotype
  ideogram are given the hits from a region on chromosome 21, with one hit
  expanded to show the alignment of that hit to the MIR model. In the alignment,
  the model line presents the consensus sequence for aligned states in the model,
  coloured according to the match line. The PP line represents the posterior
  probability, or degree of confidence in each aligned residue (for example, with
  '*' meaning highest confidence, and low numbers indicating low confidence),
  with corresponding grey scale colouration of the Query sequence.

  <mat-card-title>Relationships</mat-card-title>
  <mat-card-content>

  <p>
  <!-- TODO: verify methodology -->
  The Relationship tab provides a representation of the similarities between TE
  entries. Consensus sequences were produced for all models using the HMMER3 tool
  hmmemit. These sequences were then searched with all models using nhmmer, with
  a hit with E-value better than 1e-5 supporting a relationship.
  </p>

  <p>
  The image below shows part of the Relationship tab for the Ricksha_c
  (DF0001061) entry. In this case, Ricksha TE carries part of an ERVL and its
  LTR, MLT2. Simple glyphs are used to represent these relationships, as well as
  similarities to other Ricksha Dfam entries. The case of reverse-complement
  similarity is shown using a purple glyph with inverted orientation. Each glyph
  is shown with accompanying percent identity between the entry consensus
  sequences, match e-value, and percent shared coverage (length). The list of
  related entries can be sorted by any of these fields.
