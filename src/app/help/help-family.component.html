  <p>A Dfam family represents a distinct tranpososable element from which many interspersed
  repeat copies trace their origin.  The family is defined by a seed alignment
  which contains a representative set of the interspersed repeat copies.  The
  seed alignment is the source of a consensus sequence and a profile hidden markov
  model for the family.</p>
  <p>Each family in Dfam is represented on the website by a single page. The URL
  for the page ( e.g. http://dfam.org/family/DF######### ) is stable 
  and may be saved or referenced on external websites or publications.
  Each entry page is divided into seven tabs detailed below.</p>
  <p>Families with accession numbers beginning with DF have been curated.
  Families with accessions beginning with DR are output of <em>de novo</em>
  discovery methods. <em>De novo</em> repeat libraries are often fragmented,
  and may under- or overrepresent the diversity of repeat subfamilies within
  a genome, but they are still useful for the purpose of masking repetitive
  DNA in genomes.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
    A detailed description of the family.
    </p>

    <h4>Classification</h4>
    <p>The classification of the family using the Dfam classification system.  This system combines concepts from several well-known classification systems (Pi√©gu et al., Jurka et al., Wicker et al., Curcio et al., Smit et al.) with phylogenies based on reverse transcriptase and transposases.  Classification names have been chosen to be as descriptive as possible while honoring the most widely used acronyms whenever possible.  In this new heirarchy class names do not have to be unique, rather the path through the heirarchy uniquely identifies a classification.  Details and a visualization of the classification hierarchy can be viewed on the <a routerLink="/classification">Classification</a> page.</p>

    <h4>Taxa</h4>
    <p>The clades or species in which this family is known to be present.  In most cases this will be the oldest clade in which copies of the family have been found at orthologous positions, meaning that the transposable element was active before the first speciation of extant species in this clade.  In the case of horizontal transfer several clades/species may be listed.  Clicking on the [..] icon will expand out the full taxonomic lineage for an entry.  Clicking on the final clade/species links to the corresponding record in the NCBI taxonomy database.

    <h4>Curation Details - Status</h4>
    <p>The family's curation status indicates how throughly it has been reviewed
    and worked on. Curation of a family might include filtering for redundancy
    with other families, extending a seed alignment for better coverage and
    representation of a family's true diversity in the genome(s) it appears in,
    ensuring gene families are not classified as transposable elements, and
    defining subfamilies.</p>

    <h4>Curation Details - Method and Source Assembly</h4>
    <p>For some families, the discovery method and source assembly are listed.
    The discovery method indicates what tool(s) produced the family and might
    include parameters or a command line for reproducibility. If known, a link
    is provided to the genome assembly that was processed to discover the
    family.</p>

    <h4>Length</h4>
    <p>The sequence length of the family.  The process by which Dfam creates the consensus and profile HMM ensures that there is a one for one correspondence between the consensus and HMM match states.</p>

    <h4>Target Site Duplication</h4>
    <p>The preference for target site encoded as a consensus string.  If only a length preference is known, it will be encode by a run of 'N's of the correct length.</p>

    <h4>Citations</h4>
    A list of publications pertinent to this family with links to PubMed.
    <p></p>
 
    <h4>Aliases and External Links</h4>
    <p>Database cross references for this family.</p>

    <h4>Submitter</h4>
    <p>The Dfam account holder who transferred the family into the database.</p>

    <h4>Author</h4>
    <p>The list of author's who created and/or curated this family in Dfam.  For Dfam 2.x this was used to designate the individuals who generated the profile HMM and curated the Dfam entry and does not include the original creator's of the family itself.  For those entries details on the source of the family may be obtained from the citation list and/or through metadata stored at RepBase.</p>

    <h4>Created On</h4>
    <p>The date the Dfam family was created.</p>

    <h4>Modified On</h4>
    <p>The last date/time the family was modified.</p>

    <span>Family Visualization Updates</span>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
The TE Browser is a lightweight genome browser that uses the transposable element (TE) family consensus sequence as the reference genome. It integrates multiple feature types into a single, convenient view, including protein alignments, inter-family alignments, tandem repeat annotations, and self-alignments. The browser features a fully zoomable interface that reveals increasing detail at higher magnification levels. Users can customize display settings for each track and export publication-ready images in PNG or SVG formats.
</p>
<p>
The TE Browser is based on <a href="https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js">IGV.js</a> project with track extensions to support the visualization of TE datasets.  We also provide a standalone version of this visualization that may be used with user-supplied family consensus sequences and/or seed alignments.  See the <a href="https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/DfamTEBrowser">DfamTEBrowser project</a> for more details.

    <span>Seed Alignment Track Tutorial</span>
  </a>
</p>

<p>
The seed alignment track is a composite visualization that displays both the coverage depth 
and the alignment quality of transposable element (TE) sequences in the Dfam seed alignment. 
The coverage plot (at the top) provides a quick overview of how well different regions of the 
family are represented. The accompanying whisker plot offers additional insight into the 
fragmentation of aligned instances and the overall quality of the alignments.
</p>
<p>
  By default, <strong>mismatches and gaps</strong> are indicated using colored blocks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>'A'</code>: <span style="color: green;">Green</span></li>
  <li><code>'C'</code>: <span style="color: blue;">Blue</span></li>
  <li><code>'G'</code>: <span style="color: orange;">Orange</span></li>
  <li><code>'T'</code>: <span style="color: red;">Red</span></li>
  <li>Deletion: <strong>Black</strong></li>
  <li>Insertion:<strong style="color: purple;">Purple</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <img src="assets/images/DR002183002-seed-1.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>
To see all positions colored in a similar fashion, the "Show all bases" option may be selected from the configuration menu to the right of the track as shown below.  
<img src="assets/images/DR002183002-seed-3.png" width="100%">
</p>
<br>
<p>
More detail may be shown by selecting the "Expanded" or "Full" display modes from the track menu, and zooming in on the track ( slider at the top of the browser, or double-clicking on the track ).  For example, in this zoomed-in section the instance glyph is taller allowing for the mismatch bases to be labeled, deletions to be annotated with lines, and insrtions using the "I".

    <span>Tandem Repeats Track Tutorial</span>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
The tandem repeats track is a new Dfam feature that highlights stretches of tandemly repeated patterns within a family consensus sequence, identified using the <a href="https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/ULTRA" target="_blank">ULTRA</a> tool. The consensus pattern of each tandem repeat unit is used as its annotation label. For example, in this family, there are two tandem repeat annotations, both representing monomer repeats. Note that the track label currently obscures the first annotation; this can be resolved by toggling off the "Track Labels" option at the top of the browser.
</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/images/DR002183002-ultra-1.png" width="100%">
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This track will only be displayed if tandem repeat annotations are present for the family.</p>

<h4>Self Alignments Track</h4>
<p>

    <span>Self Alignment Track Tutorial</span>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
This track identifies pairs of subsequences within a family consensus that are alignable (self alignments). These may correspond to tandem repeats, overlapping with the previous tandem repeat track, or to other types of repeated patterns such as Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) or Terminally Inverted Repeats (TIRs), which are characteristic of certain transposable element classes. When matched regions are located at a distance from each other, they are connected by a dashed arc, with orientation indicated by arrow-style glyphs, as shown in the example below.
</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/images/DR002183002-self-1.png" width="100%">
</p>
<p>
When self-aligned pairs overlap, they are displayed with <strong>hashing</strong> to indicate the overlapping region of the alignment, as illustrated below.

    <mat-icon style="vertical-align: middle;">ondemand_video</mat-icon>
    <span>Dfam Relationships Track Tutorial</span>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
The Relationship track visualizes similarities between the current TE family and curated families (DF records) in Dfam. By default, the track displays the top-scoring, minimally overlapping subset of alignments to the family.
</p>

<p>
Each annotation includes the region of the current family that aligns (shown as a rectangular box). When possible, the coordinates of the aligned region in the matching family are also shown as bare numbers in the top corners of the rectangle. Additionally, the lengths (bps) of the unaligned segments in the matching family may be indicated using dashed extension arms before and after the rectangle.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> At lower zoom levels, some alignment details, such as coordinates and unaligned lengths, may be hidden for clarity. Simply zooming in on a specific region will reveal these details.
</p>
<p>
The annotation shown in green below includes an extra number in brackets above the rectangle. This value represents the unaligned length (in base pairs) when the right-side extension arm cannot be drawn, such as at the right edge of the reference sequence or at higher zoom levels.
</p>
<p>

  <h3>Model</h3>
  <p>
  Models in Dfam are provided in two forms: a consensus sequence and a profile
  HMM (Hidden Markov Model). Both of these models are built from the same set
  of aligned representative sequences, termed the seed alignment.

  </p>

  <h4>Consensus</h4>
  <p>The consensus sequence is called from the seed alignment using a specialized
  caller.  Rather than a simple majority rule, the caller attempts to detect
  and fix miscalled mutagenic CpG sites.</p>
  <p>The sequence is displayed in a scrolling box with start/end base positions 
  listed for each line.  In addition, a search box is provided for highligting
  portions of the sequence.  Single positions, position ranges as well as DNA
  sequence strings may be entered into the search box.</p>
  <p>
  <img class="resizing" src="/assets/images/screenshots/sequence.png" alt="Example Consensus Text (Ricksha_c)">
  </p>

  <h4>HMM</h4>
  <p>
  For each profile HMM, three thresholds are defined per associated species. The
  gathering threshold is appropriate for masking sequences that match the model
  specificity; it is is set using knowledge of the approximate copy number to
  yield high sensitivity with low false discovery rates. This threshold is used
  when defining the model's expected false discovery rate.  When annotating
  sequences that fall outside of the model's specificity, the more stringent
  trusted cutoff threshold should be used. The noise cut-off indicates the
  score of the highest scoring match that falls below the gathering threshold.</p>
  <p>
  <img class="resizing" src="/assets/images/screenshots/logo.png" alt="Example HMM Logo (Ricksha_c)">
  </p>
  <p>
  The Logo of the HMM is depicted using an interactive visualization.  Each position in 
  the model is represented by a stack of letters, with stack height indicating the 
  information content of the position. The rate and expected length of insertions after 
  each position are shown in the fields below each stack. The logo can be zoomed using the '-'
  and '+' on-screen buttons to show more or less of the model as desired. It is
  also possible to center the logo by entering a column number in the field
  provided.  A static image of the full logo can be downloaded using the green down arrow 
  next to the word "Logo".
  </p>

  <h4><u>HMM Genome Specific Characteristics</u></h4>
  <h4>Coverage, Conservation, and Inserts</h4>
  <p>
  The Coverage, Conservation, and Inserts plot shows, for hits above a variety
  of thresholds, (1) the distribution of hits along the model, (2) the
  position-specific levels of conservation of those hits, and (3) the
  position-specific rates of insertion among those hits. For a selected
  threshold, the purple line shows, for each model position, the fraction of
  all hits that have a match to that position, considering only RPH-filtered
  hits (hits for which this model is deemed to fit the sequence better than any
  other Dfam model). Among RPH-filtered hits, the green line shows, for each
  position, the average percent identity for the position. The grey line shows
  the number of insertions among those hits. In the 'Threshold' drop-down,
  each threshold is accompanied by the number of hits meeting it, in parentheses. 
  </p>

  <p>
  The figure below shows an example of the plot for the model Kanga1,
  representing the 214 RPH-filtered matches to the Human genome with
  E-value better than 1e-4. The purple line indicates that hits tend not to be
  full-length (the middle section is covered by only a few percent of hits),
  and that only about 30% of hits are aligned to the 3' end, where coverage is
  greatest. The green line shows that sequence conservation is on average
  around 70%, but with some variability. The grey lines show that inserts are
  generally rare, but at model position 1567, roughly 8 hits have
  insertions.
  </p>

  <p>
  <img class="resizing" src="/assets/images/screenshots/conservation.png" alt="Example Non-Redundant Coverage, Conservation, and Inserts Plot (Kanga)">
  </p>

  <h4>Non-Redundant Coverage</h4>
  <p>
  The Non-Redundant Coverage plot shows the distribution across the model for all
  above-threshold hits for which this model is deemed to fit the sequence better
  than any other Dfam model.  The plot is generated using annotation model ranges
  and therefore does not account for insertions/deletions.  
  </p>

  <p>
  The figure below shows the non-redundant coverage for the model Kanga1. This
  example plot shows a common signal for DNA transposons, with the interior
  portion of the model covered by fewer instances than the termini, since
  non-autonomous TEs can suffer various degrees of internal deletion, yet must
  retain critical terminal features. Many of the 5' terminal hits fall between
  the gathering threshold and trusted cutoff threshold,
  leading to a terminal light green bulge on the sides of the plot.
  </p>

  <p>
  <img style="max-width: 60%; height: auto;" src="/assets/images/screenshots/cov_nrph.png" alt="Example Non-Redundant Coverage Plot (Kanga1a)">
  </p>

  <h4>Redundant Coverage</h4>
  <p>
  This plot is much like the Non-Redundant Coverage plot, but instead of showing
  distribution across the model for only those matches that are best hit by this
  model, it shows the distribution for all hits to the model, even those better
  hit by some other model. The plot is generated using annotation model ranges
  and therefore does not account for insertions/deletions.
  </p>

  <p>
  The figure below shows the redundant coverage for SVA_A. SVAs carry two
  reverse-complemented Alu fragments, one from positions 60 to 315 of the SVA
  model, and another shorter fragment from position 315 to 400. The first of
  these regions hits most of the Alu instances in the human genome, leading to
  the very large spike of over 1 million above-threshold hits covering that
  region, even though there are only a few thousand SVA copies. These Alu
  instances are better hit by one of the Alu models, and thus do not show up in
  the non-redundant coverage plot or related hit counts.
  </p>

  <p>
  <img style="max-width: 60%; height: auto;" src="/assets/images/screenshots/cov_rph.png" alt="Example Redundant Coverage Plot (SVA_A)">
  </p>

  <h4>False Coverage Plot</h4>
  <p>
  This plot shows how matches to an artificial benchmark sequence not containing
  any TE insertions are distributed across the model. This plot helps identify
  model regions that may be responsible for generating false positive hits, for
  example due to low-complexity or simple repeat characteristics.</p>
  <p>The figure below shows an example False Coverage Plot, for Harlequin. It shows a
  spike of 36 false hits with E-value better than 1, covering a window around
  position 1000 of the model. Only the few hits signified by the purple part of 
  the graph have E-value better than 1e-4.

  <h3>Annotations</h3>

  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p>
  This table contains the count of matches, the Kimura divergence and average (fragment) hit length between 
  the model and each associated genome.  The table is first divided by Non-Redundant vs All hits. 
  Non-Redundant (aka. NRPH hits) are the subset of all hits which are not covered by a higher scoring
  hit from another (probably related) Dfam family.  This subset represents the most likely set of 
  members of this family within a given genome.  The All hits category is provided to give a broader
  view of how specific the model is within the Dfam library. The hit stats are further subdivided into 
  those that score above the gathering and trusted cut-off thresholds.</p>
  <p>
  The average hit length does not represent the average length of an insertion, rather it's the average
  length of an alignable portion of an insertion.  In the near future Dfam's annotation adjudication 
  pipeline will be refactored to use a RepeatMasker-like algorithm.  This will enable joining of 
  interrupted insertion fragments and generating a true average insertion length statistic.
  </p>

  <h4>Genome Annotation Distribution</h4>
  <p>
  The number of genomic matches that are found for many TE entries means that
  it is difficult to provide all matches via a web interface or as a multiple
  sequence alignment. The karyotype ideogram shows the distribution of hits for
  the entry against a particular genome as a heat map style representation.
  Each color represents a binned ranged of counts. Each color band is
  clickable, with the hits corresponding to that location loaded below the
  karyotype ideogram. The table contains the match score, E-value, and
  positions in the respective model and sequence. The alignment between the
  model and sequence can be obtained by expanding the row using the &gt; symbol
  found at the beginning of each row. In the alignment, the model line
  represents the consensus sequence for aligned states in the model, colored
  according to the match line. The PP line represents the posterior
  probability, or degree of confidence in each aligned residue (for example,
  with '*' meaning highest confidence, and low numbers indicating low
  confidence), with corresponding grey scale coloration of the Query sequence.
  </p>

  <p>
  By default, the hits counted here are only those in which this model was
  determined to better explain the sequence than any other model. To see
  distribution of all hits to the model (including those preferred by other
  models), select "All Hits".
  </p>

  <p>
  The example below shows the non-uniform distribution of MIRs across the human
  genome. Large patches of white in the hit distribution ideogram indicate
  regions with no instances of the model; in this case these are particularly
  difficult to sequence heterochromatic regions (represented by Ns in the genome
  sequence).</p>
  <p>
  <img class="resizing" src="/assets/images/screenshots/karyotype.png" alt="Example Karyotype plot (MIR)">
  </p>
  <p>Below the karyotype
  ideogram are given the hits from a region on chromosome 21, with one hit
  expanded to show the alignment of that hit to the MIR model. In the alignment,
  the model line presents the consensus sequence for aligned states in the model,
  coloured according to the match line. The PP line represents the posterior
  probability, or degree of confidence in each aligned residue (for example, with
  '*' meaning highest confidence, and low numbers indicating low confidence),
  with corresponding grey scale colouration of the Query sequence.

    <h3>Seed</h3>
    <p>The Seed Alignment Coverage and Whisker Plot is a combined plot showing both the coverage depth and
    quality of the aligned sequences.  The coverage plot (top of the figure) provides
    a quick view of how well regions of the family are represented in the seed alignment.  The whisker plot
    adds additional information about the fragmentation of seed alignment instances and alignment quality. </p>

    <img class="resizing" src="/assets/images/screenshots/seed.png" alt="Example Seed Alignment and Whisker Plot.">

    <p>The whisker plot is generated by coloring each aligned sequence based on it's sequence identity to the consensus.
    The score is calculated in non-overlaping windows of 10bp where cooler colors represent regions of higher 
    conservation and warmer colors indicate regions of poor alignment.  Drawing each aligned sequence as rows from
    top to bottom in the figure creates a heatmap of the multiple alignment highlighting regions of high variability
    or poor alignment.  The length of the family as well as the number of sequences in
    the seed alignment are displayed above the figure, and the kimura divergence of the seed alignment is displayed below
    the figure.</p>

  <h3>Features</h3>
  <p>Some families in Dfam include a curated set of known coding sequences,
  high-scoring matches to a protein database, or specific known sequence
  features. For these families a feature map is generated depicting the
  location of each feature within the family.  Target site duplications (TSD)
  will also be depicted on either side of the scale if applicable to the family.
  Hovering over the TSD will display the consensus sequence if a composition
  preference is known or a string of N's if only a length is known.</p>

  <h4>Coding Sequences</h4>
  <p>For some families we provide details on a curated set of TE derived proteins.  This
is a non-redundant set, therefore many families may not have a coding sequence directly associated with them.  For those that do, this section provides the following details:</p>
  <div data-layout="row">
    <div data-layout="column" flex-offset="2">
      <div><strong>Product: </strong>A unique (within Dfam) identifier for the amino acid sequence produced by this coding sequence.</div>
      <div><strong>Description: </strong>A short description of the coding sequence.</div>
      <div><strong>Protein Type: </strong>An short keyword for the protein type or "unk" for unknown.  Here are the commonly used types:
<ul>
<li>gag	- Group Antigens retroviral polyprotein.
<li>pol	- Reverse transcriptase, RNase-H and integrase functions.
<li>env	- Envelope retroviral protein.
<li>yr - Tyrosine Recombinase.

  <h3>Relationships</h3>

  <p>
  The Relationship tab provides a representation of the similarities between TE
  entries. Consensus sequences were produced for all models using the HMMER3 tool
  hmmemit. These sequences were then searched with all models using nhmmer ( and 
  reciprocally with nhmmscan ), with
  a hit with E-value better than 1e-5 supporting a relationship.
  </p>

  <p>
  If desired, results can be restricted to sequence similarities to families
  that belong to ancestor or descendant clades with the 'Related Clades Only'
  option. Additionally, the results can be expanded to include sequence
  similarity to uncurated or "raw" data (accessions starting with DR) which are
  hidden by default.
  </p>

  <p>
  The image below shows part of the Relationship tab for the Ricksha_c
  (DF000001061) entry. In this case, Ricksha TE carries part of an ERVL and its
  LTR, MLT2. Simple glyphs are used to represent these relationships, as well as
  similarities to other Ricksha Dfam entries. The case of reverse-complement
  similarity is shown using a purple glyph with inverted orientation. Each glyph
  is shown with accompanying percent identity between the entry consensus
  sequences, match e-value, and percent shared coverage (length). The list of
  related entries can be sorted by any of these fields.
