  <p>The browse page provides an summary view of Dfam families and a set of filters for quickly locating families of interest.</p>
  <h3>Filters</h3>
  <div data-layout="row">
    <div data-layout="column" flex-offset="2" data-layout-gap="5px">
      <div><strong>Name/Accession</strong> Select all families where either the accession field or the name field contain the search term.  For example the term "3423" will match the family "DF0003423".</div>
      <div><strong>Classification</strong> Search for families using the Dfam <a href="">TE classification system</a>.  This filter field uses a suggestion box to find possible matches as you type.  The suggestion lines show the unique portion of the clasification tree as well as the number of families assigned to the classification ( in brackets ).</div>
      <div><strong>Keywords</strong> Search for families using a keyword.  This will return results where the keyword appears in the family title or description.</div>
      <div><strong>Taxon</strong> The taxon filter uses the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy">NCBI Taxonomy Database</a> and the known taxa for each family to provide a quick way to find families specific to a species or clade.  This filter field is implemented as a auto-complete box. After the second letter typed, a drop-down box appears with taxon suggestions.  Only the families which are labeled with the given taxon will be listed unless the 'Ancestors' or 'Descendants' boxes are checked (see below).  For instance, a search for 'Homo sapiens' will only show 8 (Dfam 3.0) families.  These are the subset of families which are currently assigned to this specific taxa.</div>
      <div><strong>Ancestors/Descendants</strong> When a taxon filter is used the 'Ancestors' and 'Descendants' selection boxes may be combined to refine how the taxon filter is interpreted.  If only 'Descendants' is checked and the filter term is not a species (leaf node), the results will include families assigned directly to the taxon as well as any family assigned to a taxon descending from the search term (aka. a clade search).  If only 'Ancestors' is checked, the results will include families assigned directly to the taxon term as well as families assigned to any taxon along the lineage to the root of the taxonomic tree.  If neither are selected (default) only the families directly assigned to the taxon term are shown.  If both are selected than both the clade defined families and the ancestral families will be shown.  For instance, to show all families that could theoretically be found in Human use taxon='Homo sapiens' and check the 'Ancestors' box ( in Dfam 3.0, 1307 families ).</div>
      <div><strong>Include Uncurated</strong> Include uncurated or "raw"
      data (accessions starting with DR) in the results. By default, only
      curated entries (accessions starting with DF) are shown.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Table</h3>
  <p>The table is automatically updated to reflect the state of the filters applied.  The classification and clades employ tooltips to display the lineage ( clasification heirarchy, or taxa ) leading to the displayed value.  In addition, links are provided to pages with further information on a family, classificaiton or clade.  At the bottom of the table there are controls for paging through the results or expanding the table size.</p>
